# Note Taker Challenge-11

## Description
For this assignment, I was given starter code that had a pre-built frontend of a note-taking app and tasked with adding routes with express to the backend to give it functionality. It helped build my familiarity with express routers, using a router to keep my code cleaner, and using npm package uuid to generate id's for new notes which I could then use later on for the delete functionality. I struggled with this in particular, but it helped to remind me to track my comparison logic, be aware of data types, and track my code flow with console.logs if I get stuck.
